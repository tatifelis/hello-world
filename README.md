Hello World!

I'm a brave mama of two and wife for 14 years (and counting)! 
About a year ago I decided to quit my confortable job to enter strange and exciting waters - coding! I speak three languages and I'm eager to learn my first programming language! It's very intimidating to start a new career after a "mature age", but like I said - I'm fierce.
